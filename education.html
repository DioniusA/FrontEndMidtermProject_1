                    <p>
                        I changed schools four times during my education, 
                        which provided me with diverse experiences and perspectives. 
                        I graduated from School No. 22 in Astana, where 
                        I had the opportunity to explore various interests, 
                        including sports, volunteering, and programming. 
                        Each school brought unique challenges and opportunities, 
                        helping me develop resilience and adaptability.</p>

                    <h3>Started Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                        My journey into programming began when 
                        I discovered my passion for technology. 
                        I started learning front-end development 
                        and Python through online courses and self-study. 
                        Completing several small projects, 
                        I gained hands-on experience that solidified 
                        my understanding of coding principles and practices. 
                        This foundation motivated me to dive deeper into the world of programming.</p>

                    <p>
                        In 2023, I enrolled in the Computer Science department at SDU, 
                        marking a significant step in my educational journey. 
                        Moving into the dormitory allowed me to immerse myself in campus life, 
                        where I quickly made new friends and formed study groups. 
                        This transition was pivotal in shaping my academic and social experiences, 
                        as I began to explore more advanced topics in computer science.</p>

                        I connected with peers who shared my interests, 
                        learned essential skills, and successfully maintained my scholarship status. 
                        The support from professors and fellow students was invaluable as 
                        I navigated the complexities of university life, 
                        laying a strong foundation for my future studies and career.</p>

                        me for professional opportunities in the tech industry. 
                        I am particularly interested in software development, 
                        data science, and artificial intelligence, 
                        as I believe these fields will shape the future of technology.
                        My goal is to gain as much knowledge and practical experience 
                        as possible to excel in my career.

                        I aim to participate in internships and projects that will
                        enhance my skills and build my professional network. 
                        By gaining practical experience and applying what 
                        I've learned in the classroom, 
                        I hope to become a competitive candidate

                        I have ambitious plans to become the president 
                        of Poland and establish a new framework for communism
                        that promotes equality and innovation. This vision is
                        rooted in my belief that technology and leadership can
                        work hand in hand to create a better society. 
                        I aim to leverage my education and experiences

                        Alpha Centauri and become a space pilot by 2045. 
                        The exploration of space has always fascinated me, 
                        and I believe that humanity's future lies beyond Earth. 
                        I aim to contribute to the advancements in space travel

                        1st and taking my first flight on September 11th.
                        This dream aligns with my passion for adventure 
                        and exploration. I believe that navigating the skies 
                        will provide me with unique experiences that will 
                        enrich my life and career.

                        destroy all money on Earth, and shape the universe before
                        I die. This may sound ambitious,
                        but I believe in challenging the status quo and envisioning 
                        a future where humanity can thrive in harmony with the cosmos.
                        I aim to inspire others to think big and pursue their dreams,
